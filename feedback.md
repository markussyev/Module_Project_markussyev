## Feedback

In generall, the page has a clean design with nice color accents!

## Suggestions

1. Responsive layout: The layout in mobile size looks great until the breakpoint at 768. On bigger screens (until aprox 2400)  the left box disappears behind the image.  Here you can add a media query for the large size screens. 

2. The about and the work section would also benefit from a margin on large (769-2400) screens.
